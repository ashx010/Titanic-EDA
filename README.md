* The data is taken from a popular kaggle competition "TITANIC". The base purpose of the competiton is to predict the number of survivors using data.
* I have secured an accuracy of ~77% in prediction of survivors and have done data analysis using pandas, seaborn and matpotlib tools from python.

1. Applied Feature Engineering and Different CLassification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM etc.) to get best accurate predictions.
2. Perform Data Visualization and Analysis.
3. Model accuracy measured via accuracy_score, classification_report from scikit-learn library in python.
